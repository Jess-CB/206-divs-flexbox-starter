                  <p> I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. Growing up I loved spending time around the water. However every year we ventured to the Snowy Mountains to go skiing, this was my yearly highlight and I cherished every minute of it. When I graduated college I was fortunate enough to work and travel to Colorado, it was then that I fell in love with the Rocky Mountains and I now live.</p>

                  <p> My Passion: The great outdoors; I love spending time outside and skiing, biking and hiking are my favorites. However, I also love to curl up with a good book and my dog Smokey.</p>

                <div class="div-3">
                  <p> A fun fact: I learnt to ski when I was 3 years old and have skied ever since. My grandmother was passionate about skiing and after WWII she immigrated to Australia, where she was drawn to the mountains to pursue her passion, skiing. Skiing runs in my blood!</p>
